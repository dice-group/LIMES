When time and budget allows, 10GBase-T switches can be added any time to experience the full benefits of 10GbE.The Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540 is the low cost way to deploy 10GbE in your data center today. The Intel X540 uses low cost, Cat 6 and Cat 6A cabling. Chances are this cabling already exists in the data center. A way for Intel to reduce cost and power is to integrate components into a single-chip solution. Of course, integration is what Intel does best. With the Intel X540 controller, the MAC and the PHY are integrated into a single-chip solution. With lower cost and power, 10GBase-T is ready for broad deployment. 10GBase-T is an option for every rack and tower server in the data center.

This feature enables higher DDR4 memory frequencies, lower latencies and enhanced stability while overclocking, extending all the way to extreme overclocking conditions, such as Liquid Nitrogen (LN2). Cache bus links areas such as CPU cores, DDR4 Memory Controllers, System Agent and the shared L3 Cache. It is a critical interconnect for the whole CPU subsystem. Higher cache bus frequency directly gives faster total sub-system performance. ASUS OC Socket exclusively provides an adjustable cache bus voltage to reach higher cache bus frequencies.This is a platform to support DDR4 memory and it's able to drive memory frequencies to 3200MHz (and beyond when overclocked)! ASUS-exclusive T-Topology circuit design plus OC Socket provides superb memory-overclocking capability to unleash the full power of DDR4 by minimizing coupling noise and signal reflection. More than just a cool military-styled cover, TUF Thermal Armor employs the fan to provide boosted airflow for rapid cooling. The special heat pipes accelerate dissipation from critical components and make sure temperatures stay low across the board. SABERTOOTH X99 Thermal Armor can reduce the temperature by up to 10\u00c2\u00b0C!SABERTOOTH X99 Thermal Radar 2 now has up to 11 fan connectors to let you control fans as many as you want.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","brand_left":"\"Seagate \"","price_left":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":7373528,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \"HPE Light Endurance Enterprise - solid state drive 960 GB SATA 6G\" \" HPE 6G 756601-B21 Solid State Drives (SSDs) CDW.com","description_right":"\"Do you need more performance from your HPE ProLiant Server series or HPE Synergy platforms?

The integrated SATA 6 Gb\/s interface makes installation quick and easy while remaining backwards compatible with SATA II 3 Gb\/s and SATA 1.5 Gb\/s interfaces. This Samsung SSD even comes with 1GB of low power DDR2 SDRAM used as cache memory to enhance processing speeds.With a 2.5\" form factor, this solid state drive is designed to be used in a variety of notebook and desktop computers. The reduced size is achieved through the use of Samsung's 3D V-NAND flash memory as each of the 32 cell layers are stacked vertically rather than horizontally. Samsung also implements their own TurboWrite technology to deliver enhanced sequential read and write speeds while Rapid Mode software utilizes the integrated cache (DRAM) memory to improve processing speeds.

It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.\n\nIntel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.\n\nIdle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.\n\nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.\n\nThermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.\n\nExecute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.\n\n                        \n                    \n                                                \n                                            \n                            Short summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor:\n                            This short summary of the HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor data-sheet is auto-generated and uses the product title and the first six key specs.\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130, Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 5000 Sequence, 2 GHz, LGA 771 (Socket J), Server\/workstation, 65 nm, 64-bit\n                        \n                                                                \n                            Long summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor :\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","brand_left":"\"Seagate \"","price_left":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":2642905,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \"Seagate 2TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb\/s 64MB Cache HDD - OEM (ST2000DM001)\"@en \"\u25b7 Seagate (ST2000D\u2026 | OcUK\"@en","description_right":"\"2TB Capacity, SATA 6Gb\/s Interface, 7200RPM Spin Speed, 64MB Cache, 2 Year Warranty\"@en ","brand_right":"\"Seagate\"@en","price_right":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"pair_id":"5925762#2642905"}

You can freely edit and resample using waveforms that you've loaded and preset samples. Modulation and effects can be controlled easily just by turning knobs on the top panel. In addition, a variety of input interfaces optimized for inputting rhythm, bass, or melody allow you to smoothly create sequences as fast as you can think. The sequences that you create can then undergo additional evolution on stage or in your laptop. You can enjoy intuitive live performances that link various devices with the Electribe sampler, or utilize this capability for full-fledged music production by exporting sequence data to Ableton Live for detailed editing and final mixing. \n\nThe latest system version 2 adds a much-requested pattern chain function that will be a great asset for live performances or music production. The lineup has also become more colorful with the new metallic red model. And we've also provided bonus patterns that reveal even greater sonic potential.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up.

TG-Tracker is waterproof to depths of 100 ft (30m), crushproof up to 220 lbf (100kgf), shockproof from 7ft (2.1m), freezeproof to 14F (-10C), and dustproof.

With TG-Tracker, no housing equals better overall performance.\nFor adventurers looking to analyze their activities, switch the TG-Tracker to LOG mode to record the data from the camera's built-in GPS, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, and barometer.

The Gryphon I GBT4400 2D scanner blends advanced reading technology with the ability to detect the natural actions of the operator to produce user-friendly features and outstanding performance.Lightweight and comfortable to use, the steady, dim, deep red illumination light is much easier on the eyes than other similar products with flicker illumination, even during extended periods of use. The highly visible 4-Dot aimer clearly defines the reading zone of the scanner and the center cross provides a locator for targeting when scanning a sheet or product with multiple bar codes.The Gryphon GBT4400 2D reader is designed with Datalogic's Motionix motion-sensing technology, which enables the scanner to intuitively switch into handheld mode when the device is picked up. When placed back into the stand, it seamlessly returns to stand mode, eliminating the need to scan a code or to rely on a mechanical switch to make this change. The two-position base station provides the flexibility to use the scanner in presentation or stand mode while it's charging. The scanner also features Datalogic's patented 'Green Spot' for additional good read confirmation by placing a green spot directly on the code.The scanner reads common codes including 1D, 2D and Postal codes plus stacked and composite codes like PDF417 and GS1 DataBar. It also offers excellent performance when reading bar codes from cell phones or mobile devices for mobile marketing or ticketing applications. High Density (HD) models are available for reading smaller, condensed codes.Fast, snappy, omnidirectional reading makes the Gryphon GBT4400 scanner ideal for use in signature capture and document scanning applications. High speed imaging and motion tolerance reads fast moving codes, allowing you to rapidly move from one code to the next.Featuring Bluetooth wireless technology, the reader can transmit data to the host through its base station as well as to any commercial or embedded Bluetooth v2.0 compliant device.\" ","brand_left":null,"price_left":"\"$\", \"439.99\"","keyValuePairs_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":8228373,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \"Gryphon I: GBT 4400\" \"GBT4400-BK-HD: Datalogic Gryphon 4400 Bar code Scanner DTL-GBT4400-BK-HD - Big Sales Inventory and Same Day Shipping!\"","description_right":null,"brand_right":"\"Datalogic\"","price_right":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"pair_id":"7145147#8228373"}

Additionally, this processor features 4 cores with 8 threads in an LGA 1151 socket and has 8MB of cache memory. Having 4 cores allows the processor to run multiple programs simultaneously without slowing down the system, while the 8 threads allow a basic ordered sequence of instructions to be passed through or processed by a single CPU core. This processor also supports up to 64GB of DDR4-2400\/2133 and DDR3L 1600\/1333 RAM at 1.35V, has AES New Instructions, 14nm lithography, and utilizes 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) technology.Graphically, the Core i7-7700K 4.2 GHz Quad-Core LGA 1151 Processor uses integrated Intel HD Graphics 630.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","brand_left":"\"Seagate \"","price_left":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":1486169,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \"Seagate Desktop 2TB 3.5-Inch HDD SATA 6Gb\/s 64MB Cache Internal Bare Drive (ST2000DM001)\"@en-US \"Data Storage - Page 6 | Laptops Outlet Direct\"@en-US","description_right":"\"By now the world knows that Seagate Barracuda 7200 drives, from the world's premier storage provider, deliver years of reliable service and high performance.

After years of pioneering research at Seagate, perpendicular recording is now a proven technology. It increases capacity and dependability by storing data vertically, rather than horizontally. And vertically stored data bits mean increased data density which means higher performance to increase productivity. This drive delivers excellent power savings without sacrificing drive or system performance, giving customers the ability to manufacture PC systems and external storage systems that meet energy savings requirements. Seagate hard drives have long been produced with the environment in mind, and not just with low power consumption. With Seagate and the Barracuda drive, our customers can have the best of both worlds, top hard-drive performance and the satisfaction of knowing they are using a high-capacity drive with a very small eco-footprint.\"@en-US ","brand_right":"\"Seagate\"@en-US","price_right":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"pair_id":"5925762#1486169"}

This 1TB solid state drive features sequential read speeds of up to 540 MB\/s and sequential write speeds of up to 520 MB\/s allowing for the rapid transfer of large files. The integrated SATA 6 Gb\/s interface makes installation quick and easy while remaining backwards compatible with SATA II 3 Gb\/s and SATA 1.5 Gb\/s interfaces. This Samsung SSD even comes with 1GB of low power DDR2 SDRAM used as cache memory to enhance processing speeds.With a 2.5\" form factor, this solid state drive is designed to be used in a variety of notebook and desktop computers. The reduced size is achieved through the use of Samsung's 3D V-NAND flash memory as each of the 32 cell layers are stacked vertically rather than horizontally. Samsung also implements their own TurboWrite technology to deliver enhanced sequential read and write speeds while Rapid Mode software utilizes the integrated cache (DRAM) memory to improve processing speeds. Insert this solid state drive into nearly any notebook computer and you benefit from improved battery life with the enhanced SSD controller allowing the drive to sleep at an efficient 2 mW.\n\" ","brand_left":"\"Samsung\"","price_left":"\"356.99\", \"US$\"","keyValuePairs_left":{"Official Release Date\u00a0":"Nov 10, 2014","Genre\u00a0":"Solid-State Drive (Internal)","PAX-Code":"PAX0006686916","Catalog No.\u00a0":"MZ-75E-1T0BW","Item Code\u00a0":"0887276086057","Product Measures":"10cm x 7cm x 0.7cm"},"specTableContent_left":" Official Release Date\u00a0 Nov 10, 2014 Genre\u00a0 Solid-State Drive (Internal) PAX-Code PAX0006686916 Catalog No.\u00a0 MZ-75E-1T0BW Item Code\u00a0 0887276086057 Product Measures 10cm x 7cm x 0.7cm","id_right":8438068,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \"SSD Samsung 850 Evo 500Go\"","description_right":"\"Samsung 500GB 850 EVO, 500 Go, S\u00e9rie ATA III, 540 Mo\/s, 6,35 cm (2.5\"), Noir, 0,1W\" ","brand_right":null,"price_right":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"pair_id":"16479327#8438068"}

Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.\n\nIdle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.\n\nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.\n\nThermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.\n\nExecute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.\n\n                        \n                    \n                                                \n                                            \n                            Short summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor:\n                            This short summary of the HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor data-sheet is auto-generated and uses the product title and the first six key specs.\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130, Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 5000 Sequence, 2 GHz, LGA 771 (Socket J), Server\/workstation, 65 nm, 64-bit\n                        \n                                                                \n                            Long summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor :\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130.

The Gryphon I GBT4400 2D scanner blends advanced reading technology with the ability to detect the natural actions of the operator to produce user-friendly features and outstanding performance.Lightweight and comfortable to use, the steady, dim, deep red illumination light is much easier on the eyes than other similar products with flicker illumination, even during extended periods of use. The highly visible 4-Dot aimer clearly defines the reading zone of the scanner and the center cross provides a locator for targeting when scanning a sheet or product with multiple bar codes.The Gryphon GBT4400 2D reader is designed with Datalogic's Motionix motion-sensing technology, which enables the scanner to intuitively switch into handheld mode when the device is picked up. When placed back into the stand, it seamlessly returns to stand mode, eliminating the need to scan a code or to rely on a mechanical switch to make this change. The two-position base station provides the flexibility to use the scanner in presentation or stand mode while it's charging. The scanner also features Datalogic's patented 'Green Spot' for additional good read confirmation by placing a green spot directly on the code.The scanner reads common codes including 1D, 2D and Postal codes plus stacked and composite codes like PDF417 and GS1 DataBar. It also offers excellent performance when reading bar codes from cell phones or mobile devices for mobile marketing or ticketing applications. High Density (HD) models are available for reading smaller, condensed codes.Fast, snappy, omnidirectional reading makes the Gryphon GBT4400 scanner ideal for use in signature capture and document scanning applications. High speed imaging and motion tolerance reads fast moving codes, allowing you to rapidly move from one code to the next.Featuring Bluetooth wireless technology, the reader can transmit data to the host through its base station as well as to any commercial or embedded Bluetooth v2.0 compliant device.\" ","brand_left":null,"price_left":"\"$\", \"439.99\"","keyValuePairs_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":1502490,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \"Datalogic Gryphon I GD4430 - barcode scanner\" \" Datalogic scanner GD4430-BKK1B Barcode & Handheld Scanners CDW.com","description_right":"\"The Gryphon 4000 series represents the premium level of data collection devices from Datalogic Scanning for general purpose applications.

After years of pioneering research at Seagate, perpendicular recording is now a proven technology. It increases capacity and dependability by storing data vertically, rather than horizontally. And vertically stored data bits mean increased data density which means higher performance to increase productivity. This drive delivers excellent power savings without sacrificing drive or system performance, giving customers the ability to manufacture PC systems and external storage systems that meet energy savings requirements. Seagate hard drives have long been produced with the environment in mind, and not just with low power consumption.

To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read\/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).\n\n                        \" ","brand_left":"\"Seagate \"","price_left":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"id_right":-26429050,"category_right":"Computers_and_Accessories","title_right":" \" 2TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb\/s 64MB Cache HDD - OEM (ST2000)\"@en \"\u25b7  (ST2000D\u2026 | OcUK\"@en","description_right":"\"2TB Capacity, SATA 6Gb\/s Interface, 7200RPM Spin Speed, 64MB Cache, 2 Year Warranty\"@en ","brand_right":"\"Seagate\"@en","price_right":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"pair_id":"5925762#-26429050"}
